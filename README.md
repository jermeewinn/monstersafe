# Group 7 Project

Monster Safe: COVID19 map and information per state

Group Members: Kaylin, Jeremy, Perk, and Gregory

hosted on GitHub: https://perkthong.github.io/monstersafe/

# API's from:
1) https://covidactnow.org/data-api free API that shows COVID data for all 50 states
2) http://www.heatmapapi.com/Default.aspx free heat map API

## User Story:
AS AN average American it's easy to be overwhelmed by the 24/7 news feed about COVID19. <br>I WANT an easy to read website with current information from trusted sources. <br>
SO THAT I can easily digest the numbers for each state, such as new cases of diagnosed patients and number of vaccines administered to the state's population.


# Future goals:

1) we hope to have both API's working together on our website
2) have all 50 states show data (confirmed cases, Vaccines Administed, and ICU beds available )
