# Group 7 Project

Monster Safe: COVID19 map and information per state

Group Members: Kaylin, Jeremy, Perk, and Gregory

hosted on GitHub: https://perkthong.github.io/monstersafe/

## User Story:
If people are feeling like too much irrelevant information is flooding out of all new sources. People want clean cut and easy to digest information that is not overwhelming. Now Group 7 has come together to create a highly interactive website that gives users updated information about COVID19 across all 50 states from trusted sources.

# API's from:
1) https://covidactnow.org/data-api free API that shows COVID data for all 50 states
2) http://www.heatmapapi.com/Default.aspx free heat map API

CSS with BULMA

# Future goals:

1) we hope to have both API's working together on our website
2) have all 50 states show data (confirmed cases, Vaccines Administed, and ICU beds available )
